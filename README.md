# FootSim

This is a work in progess. Currently, it's a simple simulation of a soccer game. Install pygame and enjoy watching some
sprites attempt to play something resembling soccer. I welcome any suggestions to improve the quality of the gameplay.

To run main.py (the thing that makes most everything happen) you'll need python 2.7 and pygame installed.

Eventually, I may create an interface to enable some sort of coaching, but for right now I want to get the basics really
solid before working on the UI to give the user some ability to influence their teams play style.
